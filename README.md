# TypeScript-Maps

Simple project that implements useful design patterns in TypeScript, 
especially with regard to how classes and interfaces interact. Project
implements a Google Map, uses the faker library to generate fake 
user / company data (e.g., name / coordinates), and display them
on screen with markers.  Markers display pop-ups when clicked that
show information about the user / company.
